# Getting Started
The Software Engineering Club (SEC) at Stevens is creating Quick Quack, a revival of the messaging service "Yik Yak".
## Installation
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (used to run the application locally)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (used to interact with the Github repository)

**Windows**
1. Login to your Github account and fork the [SEC repository](https://github.com/StevensSEC/slp-1) (the button in the top-right)
2. Copy the link found by clicking the green button labelled *Clone or download* in your forked repository
3. Create a working directory (folder) on your computer
4. Right click in your folder and click *Git Bash Here*
5. Type `git clone <link from step 2>` (This downloads the repository to your computer)
6. Go into the folder that appeared labelled *slp-1* and open two terminals (Command Prompt: cmd)
7. In one terminal, type `cd client` and the other `cd server` (cd stands for change directory)
8. In both terminals, type `npm install` (client takes a long time -- be patient!)
9. Once installation is finished, you can run the application.

## Running the App
1. Create two terminals, one in the `client` directory and one in the `server` directory
2. Type `npm start` in both terminals. You should see a webpage open up: this is the app!
